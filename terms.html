      <dt class="h3 offset-3">General Information</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use this website, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. Remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.</dd>
      <dt class="h3 offset-3">Right to access, correct and delete data and to object to data processing</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. {{ site.title }} makes every effort to put in place suitable precautions to safeguard the security and privacy of personal data, and to prevent it from being altered, corrupted, destroyed or accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, {{ site.title }} does not control each and every risk related to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved in the functioning and use of the Internet. The Site may include links to other web sites or other internet sources. As {{ site.title }} cannot control these web sites and external sources, {{ site.title }} cannot be held responsible for the provision or display of these web sites and external sources, and may not be held liable for the content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these web sites or external sources.</dd>
      <dt class="h3 offset-3">Management of Personal Data</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from our website by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into our website, which allows you to update contact information, manage contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with our partners. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain store services.</dd>
      <dt class="h3 offset-3">Information We Collect</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">Our website collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.</dd>
      <dt class="h3 offset-3">How We Use Your Information</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">Our website uses the data we collect for two basic purposes: to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, and to send communications, including promotional communications. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.</dd>
      <dt class="h3 offset-3">Sharing Your Information</dt>
      <dd class="offset-5">We do not share your personal data with or without your consent.</dd>
