## Programming Languages

### Java

We are primarily a Java shop, specializing in Spring Boot for web and enterprise application development. While we have a significant focus on web application development, our primary area of focus is on processing-oriented middleware and distributed systems development.

While Java may not have been the language of choice for the highest tier of performance-sensitive processing and real-time communications systems in the past, it is quickly becoming ubiquitous for larger-scale systems due to the maturity of the language and of the JVM platform, and the availability of high-quality frameworks and libraries. While it will (probably) never rival C++ in terms of speed and performance and will never be a truly light-weight systems language, we believe that a mature engineering organization can use Java effectively as an all-purpose language for enterprise software development, even in large-scale and real-time systems. While it's true that many Java applications are bloated and poorly performing in general, we find that this has more to do with the agility, discipline, and maturity of the organization producing the applications (true of all development) than the platform or language itself.

Additionally, sourcing engineers is much easier using a more popular language, and most organizations will require Java and .NET developers over those who only know less prevalent languages. And most importantly, the production readiness of a platform and availability of highly skilled troubleshooting and support staff who know the platform being used is essential, and therefore choosing the JVM as the foundation of production deployments is both logical and well founded for us, as well as highly recommended for our clients.

### Javascript

Javascript has become the de facto client-side development language, seemingly against all odds. The popularity of the language has skyrocketed in recent years, as has the attention to detail in all areas of professional development that utilize it. It should come as no surprise then, that we have an emphasis on Javascript development as a primary skillset. It is still possible to be what has been traditionally known as a "full stack" developer, who specializes in development all the way from the database to the web-based UI. However, we find that the diversity of Javascript frameworks and build systems, and the pace of innovation and rapid change occurring in this field requires more specialization.

Therefore, most of our Javascript developers are primarily UI-centric and specialize in Javascript and its derivatives over other systems and server-side languages. However, our teams are entirely cross-functional in nature, and strive to work together in all aspects of the development lifecycle, and therefore the design and implementation phases are not split up among separate development teams. We require our engineers who specialize on non-UI platform development to be able to contribute substantively to the design of any part of the software we're producing, even if it is purely user-oriented.

As far as framework adoption in the Javascript space, we have not chosen a specialty. We find that the frameworks in this space are changing too rapidly to couple ourselves to a single client-side platform, framework, or ecosystem. Additionally, our client-side engineers pride themselves on adaptivity, and are most comfortable being able to refactor applications, re-architect build processes, and adopt new technology stacks as the need arises.

## Core Competencies

### Big Data &amp; Search

One of our passions is data. What can be accomplished by utilizing data to the greatest potential and advantage is astounding, and is increasingly becoming the source of either a brutal competitive advantage, or a severe loss of revenue and opportunity. Therefore, it is essential that organizations begin to grow the capabilities needed effectively utilize data to increase their competitiveness in the global market. However, it has become apparent that the talent required to perform these highly specialized engineering tasks is difficult to grow, and can be costly to find. Additionally, the organization's ability to execute a vision that requires mature DevOps and engineering prowess is almost always decidedly lacking, and will end in abject failure in a large majority of cases.

With that in mind, we've made it our mission to bring our highly specialized talents to bear on this space. We have proven that with the right mindset, the right process, and a decided lack of fear to execute bold vision, we can get these lucrative and highly complex projects into production with a successful outcome. The areas of interest that we specialize in are:

* Real-time processing of large streaming data sets
* Complex data processing pipelines
* Scalable real-time indexing and search
* Optimized organization and batch processing capabilities of stored data
* Affordable long term data accessibility

### Microservices

Microservices is an area we are actively researching and experimenting with. In our experience, monolithic applications are a good way to build software initially, but result in impossible-to-change architectures that mire the organization in technical debt that cannot be effectively eliminated. Additionally, building large and complex single-source solutions result in sub-optimal organizational structures that cannot adopt any sort of agile development principles that allow them to attain high levels of productivity or quality.

We believe that microservices are not an all-purpose solution to every problem faced by engineering organizations. Instead, they are a perfect alternate philosophy that challenge the way we build large and complex software, forcing us to solve problems differently and think about eliminating complexity instead of creating more of it. When that can only be achieved by a microservice, that is the route we choose. If not, we feel that challenging our preconceived notions is just as useful, and therefore hold it in the back of our mind when undergoing complex development efforts.
