    text: "He is not only the founder of InSource Software, but the original team member. He enjoys building software that solves real world large scale problems, blows the socks off executives, and significantly improves the bottom line. When not coding, he can be found teaching his children to code, playing an instrument, tinkering on his Mac, walking and biking around Omaha, and using his talents to plug in all around the community."
